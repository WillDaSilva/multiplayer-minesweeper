# multiplayer-minesweeper
Simple HTML5 implementation of multiplayer minesweeper.

To play the game, host the server by running `node app.js` in the repository's folder. It will be hosted on whatever port you specified with the environment variable `$PORT`, or if `$PORT` is not set, it will be on port 3000. Once you've launched the server, you can access the game at http://`<hostname>`:`<port>`/minesweeper.html

Currently, this does not support mobile devices. Support for mobile devices will (probably) be added in a later update.
